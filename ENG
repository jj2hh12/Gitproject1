I live on the outskirts of Busan.
In my town, fortunately, there is no industrial zone the pollution isn't too bad.
I prefer to live in the suburbs because it's generalyy safer and cleaner.
In my country, most of the inner city areas are quite safe but some of them can be dangerous late at night.

I need my own car to commute to work because I'm tired of other passengers.

I probably spend about one and a half hours traveling to and from work per day.
